# Degit Test

This repo is just here to try out some of the capabilities of [`degit`](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/degit), don't mind me.

## Notes

I really wish `degit` would get support for private repos and postinstall hooks, but since there's been no activity in 3 years I doubt it will ever happen.
